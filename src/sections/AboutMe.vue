    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
        Hey there, I'm Tucker! My goals in the tech industry as a whole is to actively grow and become a better software engineer and technical artist for game development. 
        Game dev has always been a dream of mine ever since I was young, being inspired by the games that I grew up with and cherished. With a strong creative mindset, I aspire to let 
        others experience new stories that come from myself and the teams I work with.
        While my main love is game development, my experience started off with WebApp development, right out of the gates of university. I helped maintain, improve, and contribute to 
        new features and tools to be provided for the team and our overall products. Since then, I continue to sharpen all my skills, from programming knowledge to 3D asset creation to UX/UI development.
